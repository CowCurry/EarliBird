# EarliBird

Decided to give out the initial framework with dummy varaibles and no model predictive control. The current code is under use and will not share.

## Features

- **Process Modeling:** Detailed representation of various chemical processes within the plant.
- **Optimization Engine:** Utilizes linear programming to optimize operational parameters for maximum efficiency.
- **Simulation Module:** Simulates plant operations over time to predict performance and identify potential issues.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize processes, optimization results, and simulation data through an intuitive web interface.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle large-scale chemical plants with multiple interconnected processes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - Recharts
  - Bootstrap
  - Axios

- **Backend:**
  - Flask (Python)
  - SQLAlchemy
  - NumPy
  - SciPy

- **Database:**
  - SQLite
